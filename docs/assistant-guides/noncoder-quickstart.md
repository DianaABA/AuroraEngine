# Non‑Coder Quickstart: Start → Save → Gallery

1) Open the minimal template.
2) Pick the example pack and press Play.
3) Save: open the save menu and create a slot. See `docs/persistence.md` for the quick save/slot UX, metadata, autosave, and how those saves feed back into Gallery/Achievements.
4) Gallery: unlock a CG by progressing, then open Gallery.
5) Share: use the deploy button in the template README.

Tips: Use the inline "Lint & Run" for fast edits; errors highlight fields. Convert scripts via `npx aurora convert` and the same save/restore flow carries over.
