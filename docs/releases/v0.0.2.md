# AuroraEngine v0.0.2

Release date: 2025-11-19

Highlights:
- VN engine stability pass: refined auto-advance, choice handling, and pause rules after `goto` and `transition`.
- Transition events: emits `vn:transition` for fade/flash/shake/zoom with simple CSS demo in the template.
- New steps: `spriteSwap` added (alongside `spriteShow`/`spriteHide`).
- Loaders + preloading: `loadScenesFromUrl` with indexed validation; `buildPreloadManifest` and `preloadAssets` with progress.
- Utilities: Achievements module (localStorage persistence + events); Jukebox (music control + `music:*` events).
- Expressions helper: `stepShowExpression`/`stepSwapExpression`/`stepHideExpression` to map character expressions to sprite files.
- Template UX: Quick Save/Load, autosave on step, 3 save slots, Continue button, and visual transitions.
- CI: GitHub Actions building on Ubuntu/Windows; Vitest coverage expanded across engine, loaders, and utilities.

Breaking changes:
- None.

Docs:
- Updated scene format guide to include `spriteSwap`, transitions, loaders, and automation behavior.
- New docs: Achievements, Jukebox, Expressions.

Getting started:
- Use the minimal template in `templates/minimal`. Run `npm i` and `npm run dev` in that folder.
- Scenes are plain JSON; see `templates/minimal/public/scenes/example.json` and `expressions.json`.

Thanks to everyone trying out AuroraEngine! 🎮✨
